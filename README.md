# Swatch Campus -Litter Detection
## Problem Statement
We aim to provide the higher authorities responsible for sanitation and cleaning of large areas or intuitions a method for evaluation the work of their subordinates without manually inspecting the areas which might be kilometers apart.

## Soluction
A surveillance drone can be deployed to perform periodic surveys of the campus to detect litter such as pet bottles,tetra packets,face masks etc., A drone will carry out a waypoint based surveillance mission in the campus, take pictures at each waypoint and feed the pictures in the DataBase after completing the mission. Then the trash detection client will fetch pictures from the DataBase and apply deep learning algorithm to detect the litter from the pictures and generate anchors. The pictures having achors can be viewed from the wed site where we started the mission.
